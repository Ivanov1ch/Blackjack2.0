## About

BlackJack 2.0 is a revamped version of my previous project, <a href="https://github.com/Ivanov1ch/BlackJack" target="_blank">BlackJack</a>. This new version does not use the terminal as a means of communicating with its users, but rather utilizes easy-to-use windows. The core functionality of the game is exactly the same as that of <a href="https://github.com/Ivanov1ch/BlackJack/blob/master/README.md#about" target="_blank">BlackJack</a>, but it runs in a much more user-friendly manner. The same code was used for the game itself, but all code relating to user input and displaying information was completely rewritten.

## Features & Highlights
* Exception-proof GUI windows, capable of handling and properly responding to any type of input (including none at all or X button presses)
* See <a href="https://github.com/Ivanov1ch/BlackJack/blob/master/README.md#features--highlights" target="_blank">BlackJack</a> for more
